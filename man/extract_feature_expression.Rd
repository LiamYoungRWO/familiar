\arguments{
\item{object}{A \code{familiarEnsemble} object, which is an ensemble of one or more
\code{familiarModel} objects.}

\item{data}{A \code{dataObject} object, \code{data.table} or \code{data.frame} that
constitutes the data that are used to compute}

\item{feature_similarity_table}{Table containing pairwise distance between
sample. This is used to determine cluster information, and indicate which
samples are similar. The table is created by the
\code{extract_sample_similarity_table} method.}

\item{feature_cluster_method}{The method used to perform clustering. These are
the same methods as for the \code{cluster_method} configuration parameter:
\code{none}, \code{hclust}, \code{agnes}, \code{diana} and \code{pam}.

\code{none} cannot be used when extracting data regarding mutual correlation or
feature expressions.

If not provided explicitly, this parameter is read from settings used at
creation of the underlying \code{familiarModel} objects.}

\item{feature_linkage_method}{The method used for agglomerative clustering in
\code{hclust} and \code{agnes}. These are the same methods as for the
\code{cluster_linkage_method} configuration parameter: \code{average}, \code{single},
\code{complete}, \code{weighted}, and \code{ward}.

If not provided explicitly, this parameter is read from settings used at
creation of the underlying \code{familiarModel} objects.}

\item{feature_similarity_metric}{Metric to determine pairwise similarity
between features. Similarity is computed in the same manner as for
clustering, and \code{feature_similarity_metric} therefore has the same options
as \code{cluster_similarity_metric}: \code{mcfadden_r2}, \code{cox_snell_r2},
\code{nagelkerke_r2}, \code{spearman}, \code{kendall} and \code{pearson}.

If not provided explicitly, this parameter is read from settings used at
creation of the underlying \code{familiarModel} objects.}

\item{sample_cluster_method}{The method used to perform clustering based on
distance between samples. These are the same methods as for the
\code{cluster_method} configuration parameter: \code{hclust}, \code{agnes}, \code{diana}
and \code{pam}.

\code{none} cannot be used when extracting data for feature expressions.

If not provided explicitly, this parameter is read from settings used at
creation of the underlying \code{familiarModel} objects.}

\item{sample_linkage_method}{The method used for agglomerative clustering in
\code{hclust} and \code{agnes}. These are the same methods as for the
\code{cluster_linkage_method} configuration parameter: \code{average}, \code{single},
\code{complete}, \code{weighted}, and \code{ward}.

If not provided explicitly, this parameter is read from settings used at
creation of the underlying \code{familiarModel} objects.}

\item{sample_similarity_metric}{Metric to determine pairwise similarity
between samples. Similarity is computed in the same manner as for
clustering, but \code{sample_similarity_metric} has different options that are
better suited to computing distance between samples instead of between
features: \code{gower}, \code{euclidean}.

The underlying feature data is scaled to the \eqn{[0, 1]} range (for
numerical features) using the feature values across the samples. The
normalisation parameters required can optionally be computed from feature
data with the outer 5\% (on both sides) of feature values trimmed or
winsorised. To do so append \verb{_trim} (trimming) or \verb{_winsor} (winsorising) to
the metric name. This reduces the effect of outliers somewhat.

If not provided explicitly, this parameter is read from settings used at
creation of the underlying \code{familiarModel} objects.}

\item{eval_times}{One or more time points that are used for assessing
calibration in survival problems. This is done as expected and observed
survival probabilities depend on time. If not provided explicitly, this
parameter is read from settings used at creation of the underlying
\code{familiarModel} objects. Only used for \code{survival} outcomes.}

\item{verbose}{Flag to indicate whether feedback should be provided on the
computation and extraction of various data elements.}

\item{...}{Unused arguments.}
