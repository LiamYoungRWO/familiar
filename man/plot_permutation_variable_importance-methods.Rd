\arguments{
\item{object}{\code{familiarCollection} object, or one or more \code{familiarData}
objects, that will be internally converted to a \code{familiarCollection} object.
It is also possible to provide a \code{familiarEnsemble} or one or more
\code{familiarModel} objects together with the data from which data is computed
prior to export. Paths to such files can also be provided.}

\item{draw}{(\emph{optional}) Draws the plot if TRUE.}

\item{dir_path}{(\emph{optional}) Path to the directory where created figures are
saved to. Output is saved in the \code{variable_importance} subdirectory. If NULL
no figures are saved, but are returned instead.}

\item{split_by}{(\emph{optional}) Splitting variables. This refers to column names
on which datasets are split. A separate figure is created for each split.
See details for available variables.}

\item{color_by}{(\emph{optional}) Variables used to determine fill colour of plot
objects. The variables cannot overlap with those provided to the \code{split_by}
argument, but may overlap with other arguments. See details for available
variables.}

\item{facet_by}{(\emph{optional}) Variables used to determine how and if facets of
each figure appear. In case the \code{facet_wrap_cols} argument is \code{NULL}, the
first variable is used to define columns, and the remaing variables are
used to define rows of facets. The variables cannot overlap with those
provided to the \code{split_by} argument, but may overlap with other arguments.
See details for available variables.}

\item{facet_wrap_cols}{(\emph{optional}) Number of columns to generate when facet
wrapping. If NULL, a facet grid is produced instead.}

\item{ggtheme}{(\emph{optional}) \code{ggplot} theme to use for plotting.}

\item{discrete_palette}{(\emph{optional}) Palette used to fill the bars in case a
non-singular variable was provided to the \code{color_by} argument.}

\item{x_label}{(\emph{optional}) Label to provide to the x-axis. If NULL, no label
is shown.}

\item{y_label}{(\emph{optional}) Label to provide to the y-axis. If NULL, no label
is shown.}

\item{legend_label}{(\emph{optional}) Label to provide to the legend. If NULL, the
legend will not have a name.}

\item{plot_title}{(\emph{optional}) Label to provide as figure title. If NULL, no
title is shown.}

\item{plot_sub_title}{(\emph{optional}) Label to provide as figure subtitle. If
NULL, no subtitle is shown.}

\item{caption}{(\emph{optional}) Label to provide as figure caption. If NULL, no
caption is shown.}

\item{x_range}{(\emph{optional}) Value range for the x-axis.}

\item{x_n_breaks}{(\emph{optional}) Number of breaks to show on the x-axis of the
plot. \code{x_n_breaks} is used to determine the \code{x_breaks} argument in case it
is unset.}

\item{x_breaks}{(\emph{optional}) Break points on the x-axis of the plot.}

\item{conf_int_style}{(\emph{optional}) Confidence interval style. See details for
allowed styles.}

\item{conf_int_alpha}{(\emph{optional}) Alpha value to determine transparency of
confidence intervals or, alternatively, other plot elements with which the
confidence interval overlaps. Only values between 0.0 (fully transparent)
and 1.0 (fully opaque) are allowed.}

\item{width}{(\emph{optional}) Width of the plot. A default value is derived from
the number of facets.}

\item{height}{(\emph{optional}) Height of the plot. A default value is derived from
the number of features and the number of facets.}

\item{units}{(\emph{optional}) Plot size unit. Either \code{cm} (default), \code{mm} or \verb{in}.}

    \item{\code{familiar_data_names}}{Names of the dataset(s). Only used if the \code{object} parameter
is one or more \code{familiarData} objects.}
    \item{\code{collection_name}}{Name of the collection.}
    \item{\code{filename}}{File name to create on disk.}
    \item{\code{plot}}{Plot to save, defaults to last plot displayed.}

(e.g. \link{png}), or one of "eps", "ps", "tex" (pictex),
"pdf", "jpeg", "tiff", "png", "bmp", "svg" or "wmf" (windows only).}
    \item{\code{path}}{Path of the directory to save plot to: \code{path} and \code{filename}
are combined to create the fully qualified file name. Defaults to the
working directory.}
    \item{\code{scale}}{Multiplicative scaling factor.}
    \item{\code{dpi}}{Plot resolution. Also accepts a string input: "retina" (320),
"print" (300), or "screen" (72). Applies only to raster output types.}
    \item{\code{limitsize}}{When \code{TRUE} (the default), \code{ggsave()} will not
save images larger than 50x50 inches, to prevent the common error of
specifying dimensions in pixels.}
    \item{\code{bg}}{Background colour. If \code{NULL}, uses the \code{plot.background} fill value
from the plot theme.}

\description{
This function plots the data on permutation variable importance
stored in a familiarCollection object.
}
\details{
This function generates a horizontal barplot that lists features by
the estimated model improvement over that of a dataset where the respective
feature is randomly permuted.

The following splitting variables are available for \code{split_by}, \code{color_by}
and \code{facet_by}:
\itemize{
\item \code{fs_method}: feature selection methods.
\item \code{learner}: learners.
\item \code{data_set}: data sets.
\item \code{metric}: the model performance metrics.
\item \code{evaluation_time}: the evaluation times (survival outcomes only).
\item \code{similarity_threshold}: the similarity threshold used to identify groups
of features to permute simultaneously.
}

By default, the data is split by \code{fs_method}, \code{learner} and \code{metric},
faceted by \code{data_set} and \code{evaluation_time}, and coloured by
\code{similarity_threshold}.

Available palettes for \code{discrete_palette} are those listed by
\code{grDevices::palette.pals()} (requires R >= 4.0.0), \code{grDevices::hcl.pals()}
(requires R >= 3.6.0) and \code{rainbow}, \code{heat.colors}, \code{terrain.colors},
\code{topo.colors} and \code{cm.colors}, which correspond to the palettes of the same
name in \code{grDevices}. If not specified, a default palette based on palettes
in Tableau are used. You may also specify your own palette by using colour
names listed by \code{grDevices::colors()} or through hexadecimal RGB strings.

Labelling methods such as \code{set_fs_method_names} or \code{set_feature_names} can
be applied to the \code{familiarCollection} object to update labels, and order
the output in the figure.

Bootstrap confidence intervals (if present) can be shown using various
styles set by \code{conf_int_style}:
\itemize{
\item \code{point_line} (default): confidence intervals are shown as lines, on which
the point estimate is likewise shown.
\item \code{line} (default): confidence intervals are shown as lines, but the point
estimate is not shown.
\item \code{bar_line}: confidence intervals are shown as lines, with the point
estimate shown as a bar plot with the opacity of \code{conf_int_alpha}.
\item \code{none}: confidence intervals are not shown. The point estimate is shown as
a bar plot.
}

For metrics where lower values indicate better model performance, more
negative permutation variable importance values indicate features that are
more important. Because this may cause confusion, values obtained for these
metrics are mirrored around 0.0 for plotting (but not any tabular data
export).
