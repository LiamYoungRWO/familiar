\arguments{
\item{object}{A \code{familiarEnsemble} object, which is an ensemble of one or more
\code{familiarModel} objects.}

\item{data}{A \code{dataObject} object, \code{data.table} or \code{data.frame} that
constitutes the data that are used to compute}

\item{ensemble_method}{Method for ensembling predictions from models for the
same sample. Available methods are:
\itemize{
\item \code{mean}: Use the mean of the predicted values as the ensemble value for a
sample.
}}

\item{time_max}{Time point which is used as the benchmark for e.g. cumulative
risks generated by random forest, or the cutoff for Uno's concordance index.
If not provided explicitly, this parameter is read from settings used at
creation of the underlying \code{familiarModel} objects. Only used for \code{survival}
outcomes.}

\item{risk_ensemble_method}{Method for ensembling the risk group assignments
from different models for the same sample.

The following methods are available:
\itemize{
\item \code{ensemble_mean}: Risk groups are determined for each sample using the
threshold values of the different models in the ensemble. The risk groups
are treated as ordinal and encoded using integer values. The mean of the
encoded values is computed. The risk group bin containing the mean value is
then used as the ensemble-based risk group.
\item \code{ensemble_mode} (default): Risk groups are determined for each sample
using the threshold values of the different models in the ensemble. The most
commonly assigned risk group is then used as the ensemble-based risk group.
\item \code{median_threshold}: The median threshold value for each risk group is
determined from the threshold values of the different models in the
ensemble. The resulting threshold(s) are then applied to the ensemble
prediction of a sample to identify the ensemble-based risk group.
\item \code{mean_threshold}: Similar to \code{median_threshold}, but uses the mean
threshold value for each risk group.
}

If not provided explicitly, this parameter is read from settings used at
creation of the underlying \code{familiarModel} objects. This parameter is only
relevant for \code{survival} outcomes.}

\item{message_indent}{Number of indentation steps for messages shown during
computation and extraction of various data elements.}

\item{verbose}{Flag to indicate whether feedback should be provided on the
computation and extraction of various data elements.}

\item{...}{Unused arguments.}
}
\value{
A list with data.tables containing information concerning risk group
stratification.
}
\description{
Computes and extracts stratification data from a
\code{familiarEnsemble} object. This includes the data required to draw
Kaplan-Meier plots, as well as logrank and hazard-ratio tests between the
respective risk groups.
