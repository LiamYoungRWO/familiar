\arguments{
\item{object}{\code{familiarCollection} object, or one or more \code{familiarData}
objects, that will be internally converted to a \code{familiarCollection} object.
It is also possible to provide a \code{familiarEnsemble} or one or more
\code{familiarModel} objects together with the data from which data is computed
prior to export. Paths to such files can also be provided.}

\item{draw}{(\emph{optional}) Draws the plot if TRUE.}

\item{dir_path}{(\emph{optional}) Path to the directory where created individual
conditional expectation plots are saved to. Output is saved in the
\code{explanation} subdirectory. If \code{NULL}, figures are written to the folder,
but are returned instead.}

\item{split_by}{(\emph{optional}) Splitting variables. This refers to column names
on which datasets are split. A separate figure is created for each split.
See details for available variables.}

\item{color_by}{(\emph{optional}) Variables used to determine fill colour of plot
objects. The variables cannot overlap with those provided to the \code{split_by}
argument, but may overlap with other arguments. See details for available
variables.}

\item{facet_by}{(\emph{optional}) Variables used to determine how and if facets of
each figure appear. In case the \code{facet_wrap_cols} argument is \code{NULL}, the
first variable is used to define columns, and the remaing variables are
used to define rows of facets. The variables cannot overlap with those
provided to the \code{split_by} argument, but may overlap with other arguments.
See details for available variables.}

\item{facet_wrap_cols}{(\emph{optional}) Number of columns to generate when facet
wrapping. If NULL, a facet grid is produced instead.}

\item{ggtheme}{(\emph{optional}) \code{ggplot} theme to use for plotting.}

\item{discrete_palette}{(\emph{optional}) Palette to use to colour the different
plot elements in case a value was provided to the \code{color_by} argument. For
2D individual conditional expectation plots without novelty, the initial
colour determines the colour of the points indicating sample values.}

\item{gradient_palette}{(\emph{optional}) Sequential or divergent palette used to
colour the raster in 2D individual conditional expectation or partial
dependence plots. This argument is not used for 1D plots.}

\item{gradient_palette_range}{(\emph{optional}) Numerical range used to span the
gradient for 2D plots. This should be a range of two values, e.g. \code{c(0, 1)}.
By default, values are determined from the data, dependent on the
\code{value_scales} parameter. This parameter is ignored for 1D plots.}

\item{x_label}{(\emph{optional}) Label to provide to the x-axis. If NULL, no label
is shown.}

\item{y_label}{(\emph{optional}) Label to provide to the y-axis. If NULL, no label
is shown.}

\item{legend_label}{(\emph{optional}) Label to provide to the legend. If NULL, the
legend will not have a name.}

\item{plot_title}{(\emph{optional}) Label to provide as figure title. If NULL, no
title is shown.}

\item{plot_sub_title}{(\emph{optional}) Label to provide as figure subtitle. If
NULL, no subtitle is shown.}

\item{caption}{(\emph{optional}) Label to provide as figure caption. If NULL, no
caption is shown.}

\item{x_range}{(\emph{optional}) Value range for the x-axis.}

\item{x_n_breaks}{(\emph{optional}) Number of breaks to show on the x-axis of the
plot. \code{x_n_breaks} is used to determine the \code{x_breaks} argument in case it
is unset.}

\item{x_breaks}{(\emph{optional}) Break points on the x-axis of the plot.}

\item{y_range}{(\emph{optional}) Value range for the y-axis.}

\item{y_n_breaks}{(\emph{optional}) Number of breaks to show on the y-axis of the
plot. \code{y_n_breaks} is used to determine the \code{y_breaks} argument in case it
is unset.}

\item{y_breaks}{(\emph{optional}) Break points on the y-axis of the plot.}

\item{novelty_range}{(\emph{optional}) Numerical range used to span the range of
novelty values. This determines the size of the bubbles in 2D, and
transparency of lines in 1D. This should be a range of two values, e.g.
\code{c(0, 1)}. By default, values are determined from the data, dependent on the
\code{value_scales} parameter. This parameter is ignored if \code{show_novelty=FALSE}.}

\item{value_scales}{(\emph{optional}) Sets scaling of predicted values. This
parameter has several options:
\itemize{
\item \code{fixed} (default): The value axis for all features will have the same
range.
\item \code{feature}: The value axis for each feature will have the same range. This
option is unavailable for 2D plots.
\item \code{figure}: The value axis for all facets in a figure will have the same
range.
\item \code{facet}: Each facet has its own range. This option is unavailable for 2D
plots.
}

For 1D plots, this option is ignored if the \code{y_range} is provided, whereas
for 2D it is ignored if the \code{gradient_palette_range} is provided.}

\item{novelty_scales}{(\emph{optional}) Sets scaling of novelty values, similar to
the \code{value_scales} parameter, but with more limited options:
\itemize{
\item \code{fixed} (default): The novelty will have the same range for all features.
\item \code{figure}: The novelty will have the same range for all facets in a figure.
}}

\item{conf_int_style}{(\emph{optional}) Confidence interval style. See details for
allowed styles.}

\item{conf_int_alpha}{(\emph{optional}) Alpha value to determine transparency of
confidence intervals or, alternatively, other plot elements with which the
confidence interval overlaps. Only values between 0.0 (fully transparent)
and 1.0 (fully opaque) are allowed.}

\item{ice_default_alpha}{(\emph{optional}) Default transparency (value) of sample
lines in an 1D plot. When novelty is shown, this is the transparency
corresponding to the least novel points. The confidence interval alpha
values is scaled by this value.}

\item{n_max_samples_shown}{(\emph{optional}) Maximum number of samples shown in an
individual conditional expectation plot. Defaults to 50. These samples are
randomly picked from the samples present in the ICE data, but the same
samples are consistently picked. Partial dependence is nonetheless computed
from all available samples.}

\item{show_ice}{(\emph{optional}) Sets whether individual conditional expectation
plots should be created.}

\item{show_pd}{(\emph{optional}) Sets whether partial dependence plots should be
created. Note that if an anchor is set for a particular feature, its partial
dependence cannot be shown.}

\item{show_novelty}{(\emph{optional}) Sets whether novelty is shown in plots.}

\item{anchor_values}{(\emph{optional}) A single value or a named list or array of
values that are used to centre the individual conditional expectation plot.
A single value is valid if and only if only a single feature is assessed.
Otherwise, values Has no effect if the plot is not shown, i.e.
\code{show_ice=FALSE}. A partial dependence plot cannot be shown for those
features.}

\item{width}{(\emph{optional}) Width of the plot. A default value is derived from
the number of facets.}

\item{height}{(\emph{optional}) Height of the plot. A default value is derived from
the number of features and the number of facets.}

\item{units}{(\emph{optional}) Plot size unit. Either \code{cm} (default), \code{mm} or \verb{in}.}

  \describe{
    \item{\code{aggregate_results}}{Flag that signifies whether results should be
aggregated for export.}
    \item{\code{filename}}{File name to create on disk.}
    \item{\code{plot}}{Plot to save, defaults to last plot displayed.}
    \item{\code{device}}{Device to use. Can either be a device function
(e.g. \link{png}), or one of "eps", "ps", "tex" (pictex),
"pdf", "jpeg", "tiff", "png", "bmp", "svg" or "wmf" (windows only).}
    \item{\code{path}}{Path of the directory to save plot to: \code{path} and \code{filename}
are combined to create the fully qualified file name. Defaults to the
working directory.}
    \item{\code{scale}}{Multiplicative scaling factor.}
    \item{\code{dpi}}{Plot resolution. Also accepts a string input: "retina" (320),
"print" (300), or "screen" (72). Applies only to raster output types.}
    \item{\code{limitsize}}{When \code{TRUE} (the default), \code{ggsave()} will not
save images larger than 50x50 inches, to prevent the common error of
specifying dimensions in pixels.}
    \item{\code{bg}}{Background colour. If \code{NULL}, uses the \code{plot.background} fill value
from the plot theme.}

\description{
This method creates individual conditional expectation plots
based on data in a familiarCollection object.
}
\details{
This function generates individual conditional expectation plots.
These plots come in two varieties, namely 1D and 2D. 1D plots show the
predicted value as function of a single feature, whereas 2D plots show the
predicted value as a function of two features.

Available splitting variables are: \code{feature_x}, \code{feature_y} (2D only),
\code{fs_method}, \code{learner}, \code{data_set} and \code{positive_class} (categorical
outcomes) or \code{evaluation_time} (survival outcomes). By default, for 1D ICE
plots the data are split by \code{feature_x}, \code{fs_method} and \code{learner}, with
faceting by \code{data_set}, \code{positive_class} or \code{evaluation_time}. If only
partial dependence is shown, \code{positive_class} and \code{evaluation_time} are used
to set colours instead. For 2D plots, by default the data are split by
\code{feature_x}, \code{fs_method} and \code{learner}, with faceting by \code{data_set},
\code{positive_class} or \code{evaluation_time}. The \code{color_by} argument cannot be
used with 2D plots, and attempting to do so causes an error. Attempting to
specify \code{feature_x} or \code{feature_y} for \code{color_by} will likewise result in an
error, as multiple features cannot be shown in the same facet.

The splitting variables indicated by \code{color_by} are coloured according to
the \code{discrete_palette} parameter. This parameter is therefore only used for
1D plots. Available palettes for \code{discrete_palette} and \code{gradient_palette}
are those listed by \code{grDevices::palette.pals()} (requires R >= 4.0.0),
\code{grDevices::hcl.pals()} (requires R >= 3.6.0) and \code{rainbow}, \code{heat.colors},
\code{terrain.colors}, \code{topo.colors} and \code{cm.colors}, which correspond to the
palettes of the same name in \code{grDevices}. If not specified, a default
palette based on palettes in Tableau are used. You may also specify your own
palette by using colour names listed by \code{grDevices::colors()} or through
hexadecimal RGB strings.

Bootstrap confidence intervals of the partial dependence plots can be shown
using various styles set by \code{conf_int_style}:
\itemize{
\item \code{ribbon} (default): confidence intervals are shown as a ribbon with an
opacity of \code{conf_int_alpha} around the point estimate of the partial
dependence.
\item \code{step} (default): confidence intervals are shown as a step function around
the point estimate of the partial dependence.
\item \code{none}: confidence intervals are not shown. The point estimate of the
partial dependence is shown as usual.
}

Note that when bootstrap confidence intervals were computed, they were also
computed for individual samples in individual conditional expectation plots.
To avoid clutter, only point estimates for individual samples are shown.

Labelling methods such as \code{set_fs_method_names} or \code{set_data_set_names} can
be applied to the \code{familiarCollection} object to update labels, and order
the output in the figure.
