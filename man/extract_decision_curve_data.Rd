\arguments{
\item{object}{A \code{familiarEnsemble} object, which is an ensemble of one or more
\code{familiarModel} objects.}

\item{data}{A \code{dataObject} object, \code{data.table} or \code{data.frame} that
constitutes the data that are used to compute}

\item{cl}{Cluster created using the \code{parallel} package. This cluster is then
used to speed up computation through parallelisation.}

\item{ensemble_method}{Method for ensembling predictions from models for the
same sample. Available methods are:
\itemize{
\item \code{mean}: Use the mean of the predicted values as the ensemble value for a
sample.
}}

\item{confidence_level}{(\emph{optional}) Numeric value for the level at which
confidence are determined. In the case bootstraps are used to determine the
confidence intervals bootstrap estimation, \code{familiar} uses the rule of thumb
\eqn{n = 20 / ci.level} to determine the number of required bootstraps.

If not provided explicitly, this parameter is read from settings used at
creation of the underlying \code{familiarModel} objects.

#'@param confidence_level (\emph{optional}) Numeric value for the level at which
confidence are determined. In the case bootstraps are used to determine the
confidence intervals bootstrap estimation, \code{familiar} uses the rule of thumb
\eqn{n = 20 / ci.level} to determine the number of required bootstraps.

The default value is \code{0.95}.}

\item{bootstrap_ci_method}{(\emph{optional}) Method used to determine bootstrap
confidence intervals (Efron and Hastie, 2016). The following methods are
implemented:
\itemize{
\item \code{percentile}: Confidence intervals obtained using the percentile method.
\item \code{bc} (default): Bias-corrected confidence intervals.
}

Note that the standard method is not implemented because this method is
often not suitable due to non-normal distributions. The bias-corrected and
accelerated method is not implemented yet.}

\item{aggregate_ci}{(\emph{optional}) Bootstraps are used to determine confidence
intervals. This information can be stored for export. However, in many cases
this is not necessary, and keeping the bootstrap data can lead to large
\code{familiarData} and \code{familiarCollection} objects. This provides the option to
aggregate the bootstrap data by computing the confidence interval directly.

This parameter can take one or more of the following values: \code{all},
\code{model_performance}, \code{auc_data}, \code{decision_curve_analyis}, as well as
\code{true}, \code{false} and \code{none}. By default, bootstrap data is aggregated by
computing confidence intervals for receiver-operating characteristic curves
and decision curves.}

\item{eval_times}{One or more time points that are used for assessing
calibration in survival problems. This is done as expected and observed
survival probabilities depend on time. If not provided explicitly, this
parameter is read from settings used at creation of the underlying
\code{familiarModel} objects. Only used for \code{survival} outcomes.}

\item{is_pre_processed}{Flag that indicates whether the data was already
pre-processed externally, e.g. normalised and clustered. Only used if the
\code{data} argument is a \code{data.table} or \code{data.frame}.}

\item{message_indent}{Number of indentation steps for messages shown during
computation and extraction of various data elements.}

\item{verbose}{Flag to indicate whether feedback should be provided on the
computation and extraction of various data elements.}

\item{...}{Unused arguments.}
}
\value{
A list with data.tables containing calibration test information for
the ensemble model.
}
\description{
Computes decision curve analysis data from a \code{familiarEnsemble} object.
Calibration tests are performed based on expected (predicted) and observed
outcomes. For all outcomes, calibration-at-the-large and calibration slopes
are determined. Furthermore, for all but survival outcomes, a repeated,
randomised grouping Hosmer-Lemeshow test is performed. For survival
outcomes, the Nam-D'Agostino and Greenwood-Nam-D'Agostino tests are
performed.
