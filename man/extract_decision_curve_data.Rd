\usage{
extract_decision_curve_data(
  object,
  data,
  ensemble_method = waiver(),
  metric_alpha = waiver(),
  eval_times = waiver(),
  is_pre_processed = FALSE,
  verbose = FALSE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A \code{familiarEnsemble} object, which is an ensemble of one or more
\code{familiarModel} objects.}

\item{data}{A \code{dataObject} object, \code{data.table} or \code{data.frame} that
constitutes the data that are used to compute}

\item{ensemble_method}{Method for ensembling predictions from models for the
same sample. Available methods are:
\itemize{
\item \code{mean}: Use the mean of the predicted values as the ensemble value for a
sample.
}}

\item{metric_alpha}{Numeric value for the alpha level at which confidence (or
credibility intervals) intervals are determined using bootstrap estimation.
The number of bootstraps depend on \code{metric_alpha}. \code{familiar} uses the rule
of thumb \eqn{n = 20 / \alpha} to determine the number of required
bootstraps.

If not provided explicitly, this parameter is read from settings used at
creation of the underlying \code{familiarModel} objects.}

\item{eval_times}{One or more time points that are used for assessing
calibration in survival problems. This is done as expected and observed
survival probabilities depend on time. If not provided explicitly, this
parameter is read from settings used at creation of the underlying
\code{familiarModel} objects. Only used for \code{survival} outcomes.}

\item{is_pre_processed}{Flag that indicates whether the data was already
pre-processed externally, e.g. normalised and clustered. Only used if the
\code{data} argument is a \code{data.table} or \code{data.frame}.}

\item{verbose}{Flag to indicate whether feedback should be provided on the
computation and extraction of various data elements.}

\item{...}{Unused arguments.}
}
\value{
A list with data.tables containing calibration test information for
the ensemble model.
}
\description{
Computes decision curve analysis data from a \code{familiarEnsemble} object.
Calibration tests are performed based on expected (predicted) and observed
outcomes. For all outcomes, calibration-at-the-large and calibration slopes
are determined. Furthermore, for all but survival outcomes, a repeated,
randomised grouping Hosmer-Lemeshow test is performed. For survival
outcomes, the Nam-D'Agostino and Greenwood-Nam-D'Agostino tests are
performed.
