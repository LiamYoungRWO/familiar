\arguments{
\item{object}{A \code{familiarCollection} object, or other other objects from which
a \code{familiarCollection} can be extracted. See details for more information.}

\item{dir_path}{Path to folder where extracted data should be saved. \code{NULL}
will allow export as a structured list of data.tables.}

\item{...}{
  Arguments passed on to \code{\link[=as_familiar_collection]{as_familiar_collection}}
  \describe{
    \item{\code{familiar_data_names}}{Names of the dataset(s). Only used if the \code{object} parameter
is one or more \code{familiarData} objects.}
    \item{\code{collection_name}}{Name of the collection.}
  }}
}
\value{
A list containing a data.table (if \code{dir_path} is not provided), or
nothing, as all data is exported to \code{csv} files.
}
\description{
Extract and export mutual correlation between features in a
familiarCollection.
}
\details{
Data is usually collected from a \code{familiarCollection} object.
However, you can also provide one or more \code{familiarData} objects, that will
be internally converted to a \code{familiarCollection} object. It is also
possible to provide a \code{familiarEnsemble} or one or more \code{familiarModel}
objects together with the data from which data is computed prior to export.
Paths to the previous files can also be provided.

All parameters aside from \code{object} and \code{dir_path} are only used if \code{object}
is not a \code{familiarCollection} object, or a path to one.
