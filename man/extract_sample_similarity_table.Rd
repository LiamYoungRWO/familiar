\title{Internal function to extract the sample distance table.}
\usage{
extract_sample_similarity_table(
  object,
  data,
  cl = NULL,
  sample_similarity_metric = waiver(),
  message_indent = 0L,
  verbose = FALSE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A \code{familiarEnsemble} object, which is an ensemble of one or more
\code{familiarModel} objects.}

\item{data}{A \code{dataObject} object, \code{data.table} or \code{data.frame} that
constitutes the data that are used to compute}

\item{cl}{Cluster created using the \code{parallel} package. This cluster is then
used to speed up computation through parallelisation.}

\item{sample_similarity_metric}{Metric to determine pairwise similarity
between samples. Similarity is computed in the same manner as for
clustering, but \code{sample_similarity_metric} has different options that are
better suited to computing distance between samples instead of between
features: \code{gower}, \code{euclidean}.

The underlying feature data is scaled to the \eqn{[0, 1]} range (for
numerical features) using the feature values across the samples. The
normalisation parameters required can optionally be computed from feature
data with the outer 5\% (on both sides) of feature values trimmed or
winsorised. To do so append \verb{_trim} (trimming) or \verb{_winsor} (winsorising) to
the metric name. This reduces the effect of outliers somewhat.

If not provided explicitly, this parameter is read from settings used at
creation of the underlying \code{familiarModel} objects.}

\item{message_indent}{Number of indentation steps for messages shown during
computation and extraction of various data elements.}

\item{verbose}{Flag to indicate whether feedback should be provided on the
computation and extraction of various data elements.}

\item{...}{Unused arguments.}
}
\value{
A data.table containing pairwise distance between samples. This data
is only the upper triangular of the complete matrix (i.e. the sparse
unitriangular representation). Diagonals will always be 0.0 and the lower
triangular is mirrored.
}
\description{
Computes and extracts the sample distance table for samples
analysed using a \code{familiarEnsemble} object to form a \code{familiarData} object. This table can be used to cluster
samples, and is exported directly by \code{extract_feature_expression}.
