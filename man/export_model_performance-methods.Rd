export_model_performance(object, dir_path = NULL, export_raw = FALSE, ...)

}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A \code{familiarCollection} object, or other other objects from which
a \code{familiarCollection} can be extracted. See details for more information.}

\item{dir_path}{Path to folder where extracted data should be saved. \code{NULL}
will allow export as a structured list of data.tables.}

\item{export_raw}{Allows export of raw data. Only used when exporting model
performance information.}

\item{...}{
  Arguments passed on to \code{\link[=extract_performance]{extract_performance}}, \code{\link[=as_familiar_collection]{as_familiar_collection}}
  \describe{
    \item{\code{prediction_data}}{A table with pre-computed predicted values per sample.
This table is generated by the \code{extract_predictions} method. If
\code{prediction_data} is not provided it will be computed internally.}
    \item{\code{cl}}{Cluster created using the \code{parallel} package. This cluster is then
used to speed up computation through parallelisation.}
    \item{\code{metric}}{One or more metrics for assessing model performance. See the
vignette on performance metrics for the available metrics. If not provided
explicitly, this parameter is read from settings used at creation of the
underlying \code{familiarModel} objects.}
    \item{\code{confidence_level}}{(\emph{optional}) Numeric value for the level at which
confidence are determined. In the case bootstraps are used to determine the
confidence intervals bootstrap estimation, \code{familiar} uses the rule of thumb
\eqn{n = 20 / ci.level} to determine the number of required bootstraps.

If not provided explicitly, this parameter is read from settings used at
creation of the underlying \code{familiarModel} objects.

#'@param confidence_level (\emph{optional}) Numeric value for the level at which
confidence are determined. In the case bootstraps are used to determine the
confidence intervals bootstrap estimation, \code{familiar} uses the rule of thumb
\eqn{n = 20 / ci.level} to determine the number of required bootstraps.

The default value is \code{0.95}.}
    \item{\code{message_indent}}{Number of indentation steps for messages shown during
computation and extraction of various data elements.}
    \item{\code{verbose}}{Flag to indicate whether feedback should be provided on the
computation and extraction of various data elements.}
    \item{\code{familiar_data_names}}{Names of the dataset(s). Only used if the \code{object} parameter
is one or more \code{familiarData} objects.}
    \item{\code{collection_name}}{Name of the collection.}
  }}
}
\value{
A list of data.tables (if \code{dir_path} is not provided), or nothing, as
all data is exported to \code{csv} files.
}
\description{
Extract and export metrics for model performance of models in a
familiarCollection.
}
\details{
Data is usually collected from a \code{familiarCollection} object.
However, you can also provide one or more \code{familiarData} objects, that will
be internally converted to a \code{familiarCollection} object. It is also
possible to provide a \code{familiarEnsemble} or one or more \code{familiarModel}
objects together with the data from which data is computed prior to export.
Paths to the previous files can also be provided.

All parameters aside from \code{object} and \code{dir_path} are only used if \code{object}
is not a \code{familiarCollection} object, or a path to one.

Performance of individual and ensemble models is exported. For ensemble
models, a credibility interval is determined using bootstrapping for each
metric.
