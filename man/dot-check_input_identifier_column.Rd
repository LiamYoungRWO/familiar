\title{Internal function for checking consistency of the identifier columns}
\usage{
.check_input_identifier_column(
  id_column,
  data,
  signature = NULL,
  exclude_features = NULL,
  include_features = NULL,
  other_id_column = NULL,
  outcome_column = NULL,
  col_type
)
}
\arguments{
\item{id_column}{Character string indicating the currently inspected
identifier column.}

\item{data}{Data set as loaded using the \code{.load_data} function.}

\item{signature}{(\emph{optional}) One or more names of feature columns that are
considered part of a specific signature. Features specified here will
always be used for modeling. Ranking from feature selection has no effect
for these features.}

\item{exclude_features}{(\emph{optional}) Feature columns that will be removed
from the data set. Cannot overlap with features in \code{signature} or
\code{include_features}.}

\item{include_features}{(\emph{optional}) Feature columns that are specifically
included in the data set. By default all features are included. Cannot
overlap with \code{exclude_features}, but may overlap \code{signature}. Features in
\code{signature} are always included. If both \code{exclude_features} and
\code{include_features} are provided, \code{include_features} takes precedence,
provided that there is no overlap between the two.}

\item{other_id_column}{Character string indicating another identifier column.}

\item{outcome_column}{Character string indicating the outcome column(s).}

\item{col_type}{Character string indicating the type of column, i.e. \code{sample}
or \code{batch}.}
}
\description{
This function checks whether an identifier column is consistent, i.e. appears
it exists, there is only one, and there is no overlap with any user-provided
feature columns, identifiers, or
}
