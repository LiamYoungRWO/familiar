\arguments{
\item{object}{A \code{familiarEnsemble} object, which is an ensemble of one or more
\code{familiarModel} objects.}

\item{data}{A \code{dataObject} object, \code{data.table} or \code{data.frame} that
constitutes the data that are used to compute}

\item{cl}{Cluster created using the \code{parallel} package. This cluster is then
used to speed up computation through parallelisation.}

\item{ensemble_method}{Method for ensembling predictions from models for the
same sample. Available methods are:
\itemize{
\item \code{mean}: Use the mean of the predicted values as the ensemble value for a
sample.
}}

\item{feature_cluster_method}{The method used to perform clustering. These are
the same methods as for the \code{cluster_method} configuration parameter:
\code{none}, \code{hclust}, \code{agnes}, \code{diana} and \code{pam}.

\code{none} cannot be used when extracting data regarding mutual correlation or
feature expressions.

If not provided explicitly, this parameter is read from settings used at
creation of the underlying \code{familiarModel} objects.}

\item{feature_linkage_method}{The method used for agglomerative clustering in
\code{hclust} and \code{agnes}. These are the same methods as for the
\code{cluster_linkage_method} configuration parameter: \code{average}, \code{single},
\code{complete}, \code{weighted}, and \code{ward}.

If not provided explicitly, this parameter is read from settings used at
creation of the underlying \code{familiarModel} objects.}

\item{feature_cluster_cut_method}{The method used to divide features into
separate clusters. The available methods are the same as for the
\code{cluster_cut_method} configuration parameter: \code{silhouette}, \code{fixed_cut} and
\code{dynamic_cut}.

\code{silhouette} is available for all cluster methods, but \code{fixed_cut} only
applies to methods that create hierarchical trees (\code{hclust}, \code{agnes} and
\code{diana}). \code{dynamic_cut} requires the \code{dynamicTreeCut} package and can only
be used with \code{agnes} and \code{hclust}.

If not provided explicitly, this parameter is read from settings used at
creation of the underlying \code{familiarModel} objects.}

\item{feature_similarity_metric}{Metric to determine pairwise similarity
between features. Similarity is computed in the same manner as for
clustering, and \code{feature_similarity_metric} therefore has the same options
as \code{cluster_similarity_metric}: \code{mcfadden_r2}, \code{cox_snell_r2},
\code{nagelkerke_r2}, \code{spearman}, \code{kendall} and \code{pearson}.

If not provided explicitly, this parameter is read from settings used at
creation of the underlying \code{familiarModel} objects.}

\item{feature_similarity_threshold}{The threshold level for pair-wise
similarity that is required to form feature clusters with the \code{fixed_cut}
method.

If not provided explicitly, this parameter is read from settings used at
creation of the underlying \code{familiarModel} objects.}

\item{metric}{One or more metrics for assessing model performance. See the
vignette on performance metrics for the available metrics. If not provided
explicitly, this parameter is read from settings used at creation of the
underlying \code{familiarModel} objects.}

\item{eval_times}{One or more time points that are used for assessing
calibration in survival problems. This is done as expected and observed
survival probabilities depend on time. If not provided explicitly, this
parameter is read from settings used at creation of the underlying
\code{familiarModel} objects. Only used for \code{survival} outcomes.}

\item{confidence_level}{(\emph{optional}) Numeric value for the level at which
confidence intervals are determined. In the case bootstraps are used to
determine the confidence intervals bootstrap estimation, \code{familiar} uses the
rule of thumb \eqn{n = 20 / ci.level} to determine the number of required
bootstraps.

The default value is \code{0.95}.}

\item{bootstrap_ci_method}{(\emph{optional}) Method used to determine bootstrap
confidence intervals (Efron and Hastie, 2016). The following methods are
implemented:
\itemize{
\item \code{percentile} (default): Confidence intervals obtained using the percentile
method.
\item \code{bc}: Bias-corrected confidence intervals.
}

Note that the standard method is not implemented because this method is
often not suitable due to non-normal distributions. The bias-corrected and
accelerated (BCa) method is not implemented yet.}

\item{compute_model_data}{(\emph{optional}) This parameter can be set to enable
computation of data based on individual models. The parameter can take on or
more of the following values: \code{all}, \code{model_performance}, \code{auc_data},
\code{confusion_matrix}, \code{decision_curve_analyis}, \code{permutation_vimp},
\code{model_performance}, as well as \code{true}, \code{false} and \code{none}.

By default, data is computed for the ensemble as a whole, but not for
underlying models.}

\item{compute_model_ci}{(\emph{optional}) This parameter can be set to enable
computation of bootstrap confidence intervals for individual models in
several parts of the evaluation. The parameter can take one or more of the
following values: \code{all}, \code{model_performance}, \code{auc_data},
\code{decision_curve_analyis}, \code{permutation_vimp} as well as \code{true}, \code{false} and
\code{none}.

By default, bootstrap confidence intervals are not computed for individual
models. Note that this parameter has no effect unless data is computed for
individual models as well, which is managed by the \code{compute_model_data}
parameter.}

\item{compute_ensemble_ci}{(\emph{optional}) This parameter can be set to enable
computation of bootstrap confidence intervals for ensemble models in several
parts of the evaluation. The parameter can take one or more of the following
values: \code{all}, \code{model_performance}, \code{auc_data}, \code{decision_curve_analyis},
\code{permutation_vimp} as well as \code{true}, \code{false} and \code{none}.

By default, bootstrap confidence intervals are computed for ensemble models.}

\item{aggregate_ci}{(\emph{optional}) Bootstraps are used to determine confidence
intervals. This information can be stored for export. However, in many cases
this is not necessary, and keeping the bootstrap data can lead to large
\code{familiarData} and \code{familiarCollection} objects. This provides the option to
aggregate the bootstrap data by computing the confidence interval directly.

This parameter can take one or more of the following values: \code{all},
\code{model_performance}, \code{auc_data}, \code{decision_curve_analyis},
\code{permutation_vimp} as well as \code{true}, \code{false} and \code{none}. By default,
bootstrap data is aggregated by computing confidence intervals for
receiver-operating characteristic curves, decision curves and permutation
variable importance.}

\item{is_pre_processed}{Flag that indicates whether the data was already
pre-processed externally, e.g. normalised and clustered. Only used if the
\code{data} argument is a \code{data.table} or \code{data.frame}.}

\item{message_indent}{Number of indentation steps for messages shown during
computation and extraction of various data elements.}

\item{verbose}{Flag to indicate whether feedback should be provided on the
computation and extraction of various data elements.}

\item{...}{Unused arguments.}
