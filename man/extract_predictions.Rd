\usage{
extract_predictions(
  object,
  data,
  cl = NULL,
  is_pre_processed = FALSE,
  ensemble_method = waiver(),
  compute_model_data = waiver(),
  eval_times = waiver(),
  message_indent = 0L,
  verbose = FALSE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A \code{familiarEnsemble} object, which is an ensemble of one or more
\code{familiarModel} objects.}

\item{data}{A \code{dataObject} object, \code{data.table} or \code{data.frame} that
constitutes the data that are used to compute}

\item{cl}{Cluster created using the \code{parallel} package. This cluster is then
used to speed up computation through parallelisation.}

\item{is_pre_processed}{Flag that indicates whether the data was already
pre-processed externally, e.g. normalised and clustered. Only used if the
\code{data} argument is a \code{data.table} or \code{data.frame}.}

\item{ensemble_method}{Method for ensembling predictions from models for the
same sample. Available methods are:
\itemize{
\item \code{mean}: Use the mean of the predicted values as the ensemble value for a
sample.
}}

\item{compute_model_data}{(\emph{optional}) This parameter can be set to enable
computation of data based on individual models. The parameter can take on or
more of the following values: \code{all}, \code{model_performance}, \code{auc_data},
\code{confusion_matrix}, \code{decision_curve_analyis}, \code{permutation_vimp},
\code{performance_data}, as well as \code{true}, \code{false} and \code{none}.

By default, data is computed for the ensemble as a whole, but not for
underlying models.}

\item{eval_times}{One or more time points that are used for assessing
calibration in survival problems. This is done as expected and observed
survival probabilities depend on time. If not provided explicitly, this
parameter is read from settings used at creation of the underlying
\code{familiarModel} objects. Only used for \code{survival} outcomes.}

\item{message_indent}{Number of indentation steps for messages shown during
computation and extraction of various data elements.}

\item{verbose}{Flag to indicate whether feedback should be provided on the
computation and extraction of various data elements.}

\item{...}{Unused arguments.}
}
\value{
A list with single-model and ensemble predictions.
