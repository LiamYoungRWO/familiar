\arguments{
\item{object}{\code{familiarCollection} object, or one or more \code{familiarData}
objects, that will be internally converted to a \code{familiarCollection} object.
It is also possible to provide a \code{familiarEnsemble} or one or more
\code{familiarModel} objects together with the data from which data is computed
prior to export. Paths to such files can also be provided.}

\item{draw}{(\emph{optional}) Draws the plot if TRUE.}

\item{dir_path}{(\emph{optional}) Path to the directory where created figures are
saved to. Output is saved in the \code{variable_importance} subdirectory. If
\code{NULL} no figures are saved, but are returned instead.}

\item{split_by}{(\emph{optional}) Splitting variables. This refers to column names
on which datasets are split. A separate figure is created for each split.
See details for available variables.}

\item{color_by}{(\emph{optional}) Variables used to determine fill colour of plot
objects. The variables cannot overlap with those provided to the \code{split_by}
argument, but may overlap with other arguments. See details for available
variables.}

\item{facet_by}{(\emph{optional}) Variables used to determine how and if facets of
each figure appear. In case the \code{facet_wrap_cols} argument is \code{NULL}, the
first variable is used to define columns, and the remaing variables are
used to define rows of facets. The variables cannot overlap with those
provided to the \code{split_by} argument, but may overlap with other arguments.
See details for available variables.}

\item{facet_wrap_cols}{(\emph{optional}) Number of columns to generate when facet
wrapping. If NULL, a facet grid is produced instead.}

\item{show_cluster}{(\emph{optional}) Show which features were clustered together.}

\item{ggtheme}{(\emph{optional}) \code{ggplot} theme to use for plotting.}

\item{discrete_palette}{(\emph{optional}) Palette to use for coloring bar plots, in
case a non-singular variable was provided to the \code{color_by} argument.}

\item{gradient_palette}{(\emph{optional}) Palette to use for filling the bars in
case the \code{color_by} argument is not set. The bars are then coloured
according to the aggregated importance of features. By default, no gradient
is used, and the bars are not coloured according to importance. Use \code{NULL}
to fill the bars using the default palette in \code{familiar}.}

\item{x_label}{(\emph{optional}) Label to provide to the x-axis. If NULL, no label
is shown.}

\item{rotate_x_tick_labels}{(\emph{optional}) Rotate tick labels on the x-axis by
90 degrees. Defaults to \code{TRUE}. Rotation of x-axis tick labels may also be
controlled through the \code{ggtheme}. In this case, \code{FALSE} should be provided
explicitly.}

\item{y_label}{(\emph{optional}) Label to provide to the y-axis. If NULL, no label
is shown.}

\item{legend_label}{(\emph{optional}) Label to provide to the legend. If NULL, the
legend will not have a name.}

\item{plot_title}{(\emph{optional}) Label to provide as figure title. If NULL, no
title is shown.}

\item{plot_sub_title}{(\emph{optional}) Label to provide as figure subtitle. If
NULL, no subtitle is shown.}

\item{caption}{(\emph{optional}) Label to provide as figure caption. If NULL, no
caption is shown.}

\item{y_range}{(\emph{optional}) Value range for the y-axis.}

\item{y_n_breaks}{(\emph{optional}) Number of breaks to show on the y-axis of the
plot. \code{y_n_breaks} is used to determine the \code{y_breaks} argument in case it
is unset.}

\item{y_breaks}{(\emph{optional}) Break points on the y-axis of the plot.}

\item{width}{(\emph{optional}) Width of the plot. A default value is derived from
the number of facets and the number of features.}

\item{height}{(\emph{optional}) Height of the plot. A default value is derived from
number of facets, and the length of the longest feature name (if
\code{rotate_x_tick_labels} is \code{TRUE}).}

\item{units}{(\emph{optional}) Plot size unit. Either \code{cm} (default), \code{mm} or \verb{in}.}

\item{...}{
  Arguments passed on to \code{\link[=as_familiar_collection]{as_familiar_collection}}, \code{\link[ggplot2:ggsave]{ggplot2::ggsave}}
  \describe{
    \item{\code{familiar_data_names}}{Names of the dataset(s). Only used if the \code{object} parameter
is one or more \code{familiarData} objects.}
    \item{\code{collection_name}}{Name of the collection.}
    \item{\code{filename}}{File name to create on disk.}
    \item{\code{plot}}{Plot to save, defaults to last plot displayed.}
    \item{\code{device}}{Device to use. Can either be a device function
(e.g. \code{\link[=png]{png()}}), or one of "eps", "ps", "tex" (pictex),
"pdf", "jpeg", "tiff", "png", "bmp", "svg" or "wmf" (windows only).}
    \item{\code{path}}{Path of the directory to save plot to: \code{path} and \code{filename}
are combined to create the fully qualified file name. Defaults to the
working directory.}
    \item{\code{scale}}{Multiplicative scaling factor.}
    \item{\code{dpi}}{Plot resolution. Also accepts a string input: "retina" (320),
"print" (300), or "screen" (72). Applies only to raster output types.}
    \item{\code{limitsize}}{When \code{TRUE} (the default), \code{ggsave} will not
save images larger than 50x50 inches, to prevent the common error of
specifying dimensions in pixels.}

\value{
\code{NULL} or list of plot objects, if \code{dir_path} is \code{NULL}.

\description{
This function plots variable importance based data obtained
during feature selection, which are stored in a familiarCollection object.
}
\details{
This function generates a barplot based on variable importance of
features obtained during feature selection.

The only allowed value for \code{split_by}, \code{color_by} or \code{facet_by} is
\code{fs_method}.

Available palettes for \code{discrete_palette} and \code{gradient_palette} are those
listed by \code{grDevices::palette.pals()} (requires R >= 4.0.0),
\code{grDevices::hcl.pals()} (requires R >= 3.6.0) and \code{rainbow}, \code{heat.colors},
\code{terrain.colors}, \code{topo.colors} and \code{cm.colors}, which correspond to the
palettes of the same name in \code{grDevices}. If not specified, a default
palette based on palettes in Tableau are used. You may also specify your own
palette by using colour names listed by \code{grDevices::colors()} or through
hexadecimal RGB strings.

Labeling methods such as \code{set_feature_names} or \code{set_fs_method_names} can be
applied to the \code{familiarCollection} object to update labels, and order the
output in the figure.
