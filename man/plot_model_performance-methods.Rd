\arguments{
\item{object}{\code{familiarCollection} object, or one or more \code{familiarData}
objects, that will be internally converted to a \code{familiarCollection} object.
It is also possible to provide a \code{familiarEnsemble} or one or more
\code{familiarModel} objects together with the data from which data is computed
prior to export. Paths to such files can also be provided.}

\item{draw}{(\emph{optional}) Draws the plot if TRUE.}

\item{dir_path}{(\emph{optional}) Path to the directory where created performance
plots are saved to. Output is saved in the \code{performance} subdirectory. If
\code{NULL} no figures are saved, but are returned instead.}

\item{split_by}{(\emph{optional}) Splitting variables. This refers to column names
on which datasets are split. A separate figure is created for each split.
See details for available variables.}

\item{x_axis_by}{(\emph{optional}) Variable plotted along the x-axis of a plot.
The variable cannot overlap with variables provided to the \code{split_by} and
\code{y_axis_by} arguments (if used), but may overlap with other arguments. Only
one variable is allowed for this argument. See details for available
variables.}

\item{y_axis_by}{(\emph{optional}) Variable plotted along the y-axis of a plot.
The variable cannot overlap with variables provided to the \code{split_by} and
\code{x_axis_by} arguments (if used), but may overlap with other arguments. Only
one variable is allowed for this argument. See details for available
variables.}

\item{color_by}{(\emph{optional}) Variables used to determine fill colour of plot
objects. The variables cannot overlap with those provided to the \code{split_by}
argument, but may overlap with other arguments. See details for available
variables.}

\item{facet_by}{(\emph{optional}) Variables used to determine how and if facets of
each figure appear. In case the \code{facet_wrap_cols} argument is \code{NULL}, the
first variable is used to define columns, and the remaing variables are
used to define rows of facets. The variables cannot overlap with those
provided to the \code{split_by} argument, but may overlap with other arguments.
See details for available variables.}

\item{facet_wrap_cols}{(\emph{optional}) Number of columns to generate when facet
wrapping. If NULL, a facet grid is produced instead.}

\item{plot_type}{(\emph{optional}) Type of plot to draw. This is one of \code{heatmap}
(draws a heatmap), \code{barplot} (draws a barplot with confidence intervals),
\code{boxplot} (draws a boxplot) and \code{violinplot} (draws a violin plot). Defaults
to \code{violinplot}.

The choice for \code{plot_type} affects several other arguments, e.g. \code{color_by}
is not used for \code{heatmap} and \code{y_axis_by} is only used by \code{heatmap}.}

\item{ggtheme}{(\emph{optional}) \code{ggplot} theme to use for plotting.}

\item{discrete_palette}{(\emph{optional}) Palette to use to color the different
plot elements in case a value was provided to the \code{color_by} argument. Only
used when \code{plot_type} is not \code{heatmap}.}

\item{gradient_palette}{(\emph{optional}) Sequential or divergent palette used to
color the raster in \code{heatmap} plots. This argument is not used for other
\code{plot_type} value.}

\item{gradient_palette_range}{(\emph{optional}) Numerical range used to span the
gradient. This should be a range of two values, e.g. \code{c(0, 1)}. Lower or
upper boundary can be unset by using \code{NA}. If not set, the full
metric-specific range is used.}

\item{x_label}{(\emph{optional}) Label to provide to the x-axis. If NULL, no label
is shown.}

\item{y_label}{(\emph{optional}) Label to provide to the y-axis. If NULL, no label
is shown.}

\item{legend_label}{(\emph{optional}) Label to provide to the legend. If NULL, the
legend will not have a name.}

\item{plot_title}{(\emph{optional}) Label to provide as figure title. If NULL, no
title is shown.}

\item{plot_sub_title}{(\emph{optional}) Label to provide as figure subtitle. If
NULL, no subtitle is shown.}

\item{caption}{(\emph{optional}) Label to provide as figure caption. If NULL, no
caption is shown.}

\item{rotate_x_tick_labels}{(\emph{optional}) Rotate tick labels on the x-axis by
90 degrees. Defaults to \code{TRUE}. Rotation of x-axis tick labels may also be
controlled through the \code{ggtheme}. In this case, \code{FALSE} should be provided
explicitly.}

\item{y_range}{(\emph{optional}) Value range for the y-axis.}

\item{y_n_breaks}{(\emph{optional}) Number of breaks to show on the y-axis of the
plot. \code{y_n_breaks} is used to determine the \code{y_breaks} argument in case it
is unset.}

\item{y_breaks}{(\emph{optional}) Break points on the y-axis of the plot.}

\item{width}{(\emph{optional}) Width of the plot. A default value is derived from
the number of facets.}

\item{height}{(\emph{optional}) Height of the plot. A default value is derived from
the number of features and the number of facets.}

\item{units}{(\emph{optional}) Plot size unit. Either \code{cm} (default), \code{mm} or \verb{in}.}

\item{annotate_performance}{(\emph{optional}) Indicates whether performance in
heatmaps should be annotated with text. Can be \code{none}, \code{value} (default), or
\code{value_ci} (median value plus 95\% credibility intervals).}

\description{
This method creates plots that show model performance from the
data stored in a familiarCollection object. This method may create several
types of plots, as determined by \code{plot_type}.
}
\details{
This function plots model performance based on empirical bootstraps,
using various plot representations.

Available splitting variables are: \code{fs_method}, \code{learner}, \code{data_set},
\code{evaluation_time} (survival outcome only) and \code{metric}. The default for
\code{heatmap} is to split by \code{metric}, facet by \code{data_set} and
\code{evaluation_time}, position \code{learner} along the x-axis and \code{fs_method} along
the y-axis. The \code{color_by} argument is not used. The only valid options for
\code{x_axis_by} and \code{y_axis_by} are \code{learner} and \code{fs_method}.

For other plot types (\code{barplot}, \code{boxplot} and \code{violinplot}), depends on the
number of learners and feature selection methods:
\itemize{
\item \emph{one feature selection method and one learner}: the default is to split by
\code{metric}, and have \code{data_set} along the x-axis.
\item \emph{one feature selection and multiple learners}: the default is to split by
\code{metric}, facet by \code{data_set} and have \code{learner} along the x-axis.
\item \emph{multiple feature selection methods and one learner}: the default is to
split by \code{metric}, facet by \code{data_set} and have \code{fs_method} along the
x-axis.
\item \emph{multiple feature selection methods and learners}: the default is to split
by \code{metric}, facet by \code{data_set}, colour by \code{fs_method} and have \code{learner}
along the x-axis.
}

If applicable, additional faceting is performed for \code{evaluation_time}.

Available palettes for \code{discrete_palette} and \code{gradient_palette} are those
listed by \code{grDevices::palette.pals()} (requires R >= 4.0.0),
\code{grDevices::hcl.pals()} (requires R >= 3.6.0) and \code{rainbow}, \code{heat.colors},
\code{terrain.colors}, \code{topo.colors} and \code{cm.colors}, which correspond to the
palettes of the same name in \code{grDevices}. If not specified, a default
palette based on palettes in Tableau are used. You may also specify your own
palette by using colour names listed by \code{grDevices::colors()} or through
hexadecimal RGB strings.

Labeling methods such as \code{set_fs_method_names} or \code{set_data_set_names} can
be applied to the \code{familiarCollection} object to update labels, and order
the output in the figure.
