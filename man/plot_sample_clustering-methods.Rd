\arguments{
\item{object}{\code{familiarCollection} object, or one or more \code{familiarData}
objects, that will be internally converted to a \code{familiarCollection} object.
It is also possible to provide a \code{familiarEnsemble} or one or more
\code{familiarModel} objects together with the data from which data is computed
prior to export. Paths to such files can also be provided.}

\item{draw}{(\emph{optional}) Draws the plot if TRUE.}

\item{dir_path}{(\emph{optional}) Path to the directory where created performance
plots are saved to. Output is saved in the \code{feature_similarity}
subdirectory. If \code{NULL} no figures are saved, but are returned instead.}

\item{split_by}{(\emph{optional}) Splitting variables. This refers to column names
on which datasets are split. A separate figure is created for each split.
See details for available variables.}

\item{x_axis_by}{(\emph{optional}) Variable plotted along the x-axis of a plot.
The variable cannot overlap with variables provided to the \code{split_by} and
\code{y_axis_by} arguments (if used), but may overlap with other arguments. Only
one variable is allowed for this argument. See details for available
variables.}

\item{y_axis_by}{(\emph{optional}) Variable plotted along the y-axis of a plot.
The variable cannot overlap with variables provided to the \code{split_by} and
\code{x_axis_by} arguments (if used), but may overlap with other arguments. Only
one variable is allowed for this argument. See details for available
variables.}

\item{facet_by}{(\emph{optional}) Variables used to determine how and if facets of
each figure appear. In case the \code{facet_wrap_cols} argument is \code{NULL}, the
first variable is used to define columns, and the remaing variables are
used to define rows of facets. The variables cannot overlap with those
provided to the \code{split_by} argument, but may overlap with other arguments.
See details for available variables.}

\item{facet_wrap_cols}{(\emph{optional}) Number of columns to generate when facet
wrapping. If NULL, a facet grid is produced instead.}

\item{ggtheme}{(\emph{optional}) \code{ggplot} theme to use for plotting.}

\item{gradient_palette}{(\emph{optional}) Sequential or divergent palette used to
colour the similarity or distance between features in a heatmap.}

\item{gradient_palette_range}{(\emph{optional}) Numerical range used to span the
gradient. This should be a range of two values, e.g. \code{c(0, 1)}. Lower or
upper boundary can be unset by using \code{NA}. If not set, the full
metric-specific range is used.}

\item{x_label}{(\emph{optional}) Label to provide to the x-axis. If NULL, no label
is shown.}

\item{x_label_shared}{(\emph{optional}) Sharing of x-axis labels between facets.
One of three values:
\itemize{
\item \code{overall}: A single label is placed at the bottom of the figure. Tick
text (but not the ticks themselves) is removed for all but the bottom facet
plot(s).
\item \code{column}: A label is placed at the bottom of each column. Tick text (but
not the ticks themselves) is removed for all but the bottom facet plot(s).
\item \code{individual}: A label is placed below each facet plot. Tick text is kept.
}}

\item{y_label}{(\emph{optional}) Label to provide to the y-axis. If NULL, no label
is shown.}

\item{y_label_shared}{(\emph{optional}) Sharing of y-axis labels between facets.
One of three values:
\itemize{
\item \code{overall}: A single label is placed to the left of the figure. Tick text
(but not the ticks themselves) is removed for all but the left-most facet
plot(s).
\item \code{row}: A label is placed to the left of each row. Tick text (but not the
ticks themselves) is removed for all but the left-most facet plot(s).
\item \code{individual}: A label is placed below each facet plot. Tick text is kept.
}}

\item{legend_label}{(\emph{optional}) Label to provide to the legend. If NULL, the

caption is shown.}

\item{x_range}{(\emph{optional}) Value range for the x-axis.}

\item{x_n_breaks}{(\emph{optional}) Number of breaks to show on the x-axis of the
plot. \code{x_n_breaks} is used to determine the \code{x_breaks} argument in case it
is unset.}

\item{x_breaks}{(\emph{optional}) Break points on the x-axis of the plot.}

\item{y_range}{(\emph{optional}) Value range for the y-axis.}

\item{y_n_breaks}{(\emph{optional}) Number of breaks to show on the y-axis of the
plot. \code{y_n_breaks} is used to determine the \code{y_breaks} argument in case it

\item{y_breaks}{(\emph{optional}) Break points on the y-axis of the plot.}

\item{rotate_x_tick_labels}{(\emph{optional}) Rotate tick labels on the x-axis by

\item{show_feature_dendrogram}{(\emph{optional}) Show feature dendrogram around the
main panel. Can be \code{TRUE}, \code{FALSE}, \code{NULL}, or a position, i.e. \code{top},
\code{bottom}, \code{left} and \code{right}.

If a position is specified, it should be appropriate with regard to the
\code{x_axis_by} or \code{y_axis_by} argument. If \code{x_axis_by} is \code{sample} (default),
the only valid positions are \code{top} (default) and \code{bottom}. Alternatively, if
\code{y_axis_by} is \code{feature}, the only valid positions are \code{right} (default) and
\code{left}.

A dendrogram can only be drawn from cluster methods that produce dendograms,
such as \code{hclust}. A dendogram can for example not be constructed using the
partioning around medioids method (\code{pam}).}

\item{show_sample_dendrogram}{(\emph{optional}) Show sample dendrogram around the
main panel. Can be \code{TRUE}, \code{FALSE}, \code{NULL}, or a position, i.e. \code{top},
\code{bottom}, \code{left} and \code{right}.

If a position is specified, it should be appropriate with regard to the
\code{x_axis_by} or \code{y_axis_by} argument. If \code{y_axis_by} is \code{sample} (default),
the only valid positions are \code{right} (default) and \code{left}. Alternatively, if
\code{x_axis_by} is \code{sample}, the only valid positions are \code{top} (default) and
\code{bottom}.

A dendrogram can only be drawn from cluster methods that produce dendograms,
such as \code{hclust}. A dendogram can for example not be constructed using the
partioning around medioids method (\code{pam}).}

\item{dendrogram_height}{(\emph{optional}) Height of the dendrogram. The height is
1.5 cm by default. Height is expected to be grid unit (see \code{grid::unit}),
which also allows for specifying relative heights.}

\item{width}{(\emph{optional}) Width of the plot. A default value is derived from
the number of facets.}

\item{height}{(\emph{optional}) Height of the plot. A default value is derived from
the number of features and the number of facets.}

\item{units}{(\emph{optional}) Plot size unit. Either \code{cm} (default), \code{mm} or \verb{in}.}

"print" (300), or "screen" (72). Applies only to raster output types.}
    \item{\code{limitsize}}{When \code{TRUE} (the default), \code{ggsave} will not
save images larger than 50x50 inches, to prevent the common error of
specifying dimensions in pixels.}

\description{
This method creates a heatmap based on data stored in a
\code{familiarCollection} object. Features in the heatmap are ordered so that
more similar features appear together.
}
\details{
This function generates area under the ROC curve plots.

Available splitting variables are: \code{fs_method}, \code{learner}, and \code{data_set}.
By default, the data is split by \code{fs_method} and \code{learner} and \code{data_set},
since the number of samples will typically differ between data sets, even
for the same feature selection method and learner.

The \code{x_axis_by} and \code{y_axis_by} arguments determine what data are shown
along which axis. Each argument takes one of \code{feature} and \code{sample}, and
both arguments should be unique. By default, features are shown along the
x-axis and samples along the y-axis.

Note that similarity is determined based on the underlying data. Hence the
ordering of features may differ between facets, and tick labels are
maintained for each panel.

Available palettes for \code{gradient_palette} are those listed by
\code{grDevices::palette.pals()} (requires R >= 4.0.0), \code{grDevices::hcl.pals()}
(requires R >= 3.6.0) and \code{rainbow}, \code{heat.colors}, \code{terrain.colors},
\code{topo.colors} and \code{cm.colors}, which correspond to the palettes of the same
name in \code{grDevices}. If not specified, a default palette based on palettes
in Tableau are used. You may also specify your own palette by using colour
names listed by \code{grDevices::colors()} or through hexadecimal RGB strings.

Labeling methods such as \code{set_fs_method_names} or \code{set_data_set_names} can
be applied to the \code{familiarCollection} object to update labels, and order
the output in the figure.
