\title{Internal function to extract the feature distance table.}
\usage{
extract_feature_similarity_table(
  object,
  data,
  cl = NULL,
  feature_similarity_metric = waiver(),
  verbose = FALSE,
  message_indent = 0L,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A \code{familiarEnsemble} object, which is an ensemble of one or more
\code{familiarModel} objects.}

\item{data}{A \code{dataObject} object, \code{data.table} or \code{data.frame} that
constitutes the data that are used to compute}

\item{cl}{Cluster created using the \code{parallel} package. This cluster is then
used to speed up computation through parallelisation.}

\item{feature_similarity_metric}{Metric to determine pairwise similarity
between features. Similarity is computed in the same manner as for
clustering, and \code{feature_similarity_metric} therefore has the same options
as \code{cluster_similarity_metric}: \code{mcfadden_r2}, \code{cox_snell_r2},
\code{nagelkerke_r2}, \code{spearman}, \code{kendall} and \code{pearson}.

If not provided explicitly, this parameter is read from settings used at
creation of the underlying \code{familiarModel} objects.}

\item{verbose}{Flag to indicate whether feedback should be provided on the
computation and extraction of various data elements.}

\item{message_indent}{Number of indentation steps for messages shown during
computation and extraction of various data elements.}

\item{...}{Unused arguments.}
}
\value{
A data.table containing pairwise distance between features. This data
is only the upper triangular of the complete matrix (i.e. the sparse
unitriangular representation). Diagonals will always be 0.0 and the lower
triangular is mirrored.
}
\description{
Computes and extracts the feature distance table for features
used in a \code{familiarEnsemble} object. This table can be used to cluster
features, and is exported directly by \code{extract_mutual_correlation}.
