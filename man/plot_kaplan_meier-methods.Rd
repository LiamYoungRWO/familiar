\arguments{
\item{object}{\code{familiarCollection} object, or one or more \code{familiarData}
objects, that will be internally converted to a \code{familiarCollection} object.
It is also possible to provide a \code{familiarEnsemble} or one or more
\code{familiarModel} objects together with the data from which data is computed
prior to export. Paths to such files can also be provided.}

\item{draw}{(\emph{optional}) Draws the plot if TRUE.}

argument, but may overlap with other arguments. See details for available

linetype of lines in a plot. The variables cannot overlap with those
provided to the \code{split_by} argument, but may overlap with other arguments.
Sett details for available variables.}

\item{facet_by}{(\emph{optional}) Variables used to determine how and if facets of
each figure appear. In case the \code{facet_wrap_cols} argument is \code{NULL}, the

provided to the \code{split_by} argument, but may overlap with other arguments.
See details for available variables.}

be indicated on the survival curve.}

\item{censor_shape}{(\emph{optional}) Shape used to indicate censored samples on
the survival curve. Available shapes are documented in the \code{ggplot2}
vignette \emph{Aesthetic specifications}. By default a plus shape is used.}

test to assess differences between the risk strata is annotated in the plot.

shown below the Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Survival in the risk strata is
assessed for each of the breaks in \code{x_breaks}.}

\description{
This function creates Kaplan-Meier survival curves from
stratification data stored in a familiarCollection object.
}
\details{
This function generates a Kaplan-Meier survival plot based on risk
group stratification by the learners.

\code{familiar} does not determine what units the x-axis has or what kind of
survival the y-axis represents. It is therefore recommended to provide
\code{x_label} and \code{y_label} arguments.

Available splitting variables are: \code{fs_method}, \code{learner}, \code{data_set},
\code{risk_group} and \code{stratification_method}. By default, separate figures are
created for each combination of \code{fs_method} and \code{learner}, with faceting by
\code{data_set}, colouring of the strata in each individual plot by \code{risk_group}.

Available palettes for \code{discrete_palette} are those listed by
\code{grDevices::palette.pals()} (requires R >= 4.0.0), \code{grDevices::hcl.pals()}
(requires R >= 3.6.0) and \code{rainbow}, \code{heat.colors}, \code{terrain.colors},
\code{topo.colors} and \code{cm.colors}, which correspond to the palettes of the same
name in \code{grDevices}. If not specified, a default palette based on palettes
in Tableau are used. You may also specify your own palette by using colour
names listed by \code{grDevices::colors()} or through hexadecimal RGB strings.

Greenwood confidence intervals of the Kaplan-Meier curve can be shown using
various styles set by \code{conf_int_style}:
\itemize{
\item \code{ribbon} (default): confidence intervals are shown as a ribbon with an
opacity of \code{conf_int_alpha} around the point estimate of the Kaplan-Meier
curve.
\item \code{step} (default): confidence intervals are shown as a step function around
the point estimate of the Kaplan-Meier curve.
\item \code{none}: confidence intervals are not shown. The point estimate of the ROC
curve is shown as usual.
}

Labelling methods such as \code{set_risk_group_names} or \code{set_data_set_names} can
be applied to the \code{familiarCollection} object to update labels, and order
the output in the figure.
