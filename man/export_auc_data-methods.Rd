export_auc_data(object, dir_path = NULL, ...)

\S4method{export_auc_data}{familiarCollection}(object, dir_path = NULL, ...)

\S4method{export_auc_data}{ANY}(object, dir_path = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A \code{familiarCollection} object, or other other objects from which
a \code{familiarCollection} can be extracted. See details for more information.}

\item{dir_path}{Path to folder where extracted data should be saved. \code{NULL}
will allow export as a structured list of data.tables.}

\item{...}{
  Arguments passed on to \code{\link[=extract_auc_data]{extract_auc_data}}, \code{\link[=as_familiar_collection]{as_familiar_collection}}
  \describe{
    \item{\code{prediction_data}}{A table with pre-computed predicted values per sample.
This table is generated by the \code{extract_predictions} method. If
\code{prediction_data} is not provided it will be computed internally.}
    \item{\code{cl}}{Cluster created using the \code{parallel} package. This cluster is then
used to speed up computation through parallelisation.}
    \item{\code{confidence_level}}{(\emph{optional}) Numeric value for the level at which
confidence are determined. In the case bootstraps are used to determine the
confidence intervals bootstrap estimation, \code{familiar} uses the rule of thumb
\eqn{n = 20 / ci.level} to determine the number of required bootstraps.

If not provided explicitly, this parameter is read from settings used at
creation of the underlying \code{familiarModel} objects.

#'@param confidence_level (\emph{optional}) Numeric value for the level at which
confidence are determined. In the case bootstraps are used to determine the
confidence intervals bootstrap estimation, \code{familiar} uses the rule of thumb
\eqn{n = 20 / ci.level} to determine the number of required bootstraps.

The default value is \code{0.95}.}
    \item{\code{message_indent}}{Number of indentation steps for messages shown during
computation and extraction of various data elements.}
    \item{\code{verbose}}{Flag to indicate whether feedback should be provided on the
computation and extraction of various data elements.}
    \item{\code{familiar_data_names}}{Names of the dataset(s). Only used if the \code{object} parameter
is one or more \code{familiarData} objects.}
    \item{\code{collection_name}}{Name of the collection.}
  }}
}
\value{
A list of data.tables (if \code{dir_path} is not provided), or nothing, as
all data is exported to \code{csv} files.
}
\description{
Extract and export ROC-curves for models in a familiarCollection.
}
\details{
Data is usually collected from a \code{familiarCollection} object.
However, you can also provide one or more \code{familiarData} objects, that will
be internally converted to a \code{familiarCollection} object. It is also
possible to provide a \code{familiarEnsemble} or one or more \code{familiarModel}
objects together with the data from which data is computed prior to export.
Paths to the previous files can also be provided.

All parameters aside from \code{object} and \code{dir_path} are only used if \code{object}
is not a \code{familiarCollection} object, or a path to one.

ROC curve data are exported for individual and ensemble models. For ensemble
models, a credibility interval for the ROC curve is determined using
bootstrapping for each metric. In case of multinomial outcomes, ROC-curves
are computed for each class, using a one-against-all approach.
