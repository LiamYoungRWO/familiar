\usage{
export_prediction_data(object, dir_path = NULL, ...)

\S4method{export_prediction_data}{familiarCollection}(object, dir_path = NULL, ...)

\S4method{export_prediction_data}{ANY}(object, dir_path = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A \code{familiarCollection} object, or other other objects from which
a \code{familiarCollection} can be extracted. See details for more information.}

\item{dir_path}{Path to folder where extracted data should be saved. \code{NULL}
will allow export as a structured list of data.tables.}

\item{...}{
  Arguments passed on to \code{\link[=extract_predictions]{extract_predictions}}, \code{\link[=as_familiar_collection]{as_familiar_collection}}
  \describe{
    \item{\code{data}}{A \code{dataObject} object, \code{data.table} or \code{data.frame} that
constitutes the data that are used to compute}
    \item{\code{cl}}{Cluster created using the \code{parallel} package. This cluster is then
used to speed up computation through parallelisation.}
    \item{\code{ensemble_method}}{Method for ensembling predictions from models for the
same sample. Available methods are:
\itemize{
\item \code{mean}: Use the mean of the predicted values as the ensemble value for a
sample.
}}
    \item{\code{time_max}}{Time point which is used as the benchmark for e.g. cumulative
risks generated by random forest, or the cutoff for Uno's concordance index.
If not provided explicitly, this parameter is read from settings used at
creation of the underlying \code{familiarModel} objects. Only used for \code{survival}
outcomes.}
    \item{\code{message_indent}}{Number of indentation steps for messages shown during
computation and extraction of various data elements.}
    \item{\code{verbose}}{Flag to indicate whether feedback should be provided on the
computation and extraction of various data elements.}
    \item{\code{familiar_data_names}}{Names of the dataset(s). Only used if the \code{object} parameter
is one or more \code{familiarData} objects.}
    \item{\code{collection_name}}{Name of the collection.}
  }}
}
\value{
A list of data.tables (if \code{dir_path} is not provided), or nothing, as
all data is exported to \code{csv} files.
}
\description{
Extract and export the values predicted by single and ensemble
models in a familiarCollection.
}
\details{
Data, such as model performance and calibration information, is
usually collected from a \code{familiarCollection} object. However, you can also
provide one or more \code{familiarData} objects, that will be internally
converted to a \code{familiarCollection} object. It is also possible to provide a
\code{familiarEnsemble} or one or more \code{familiarModel} objects together with the
data from which data is computed prior to export. Paths to the previous
files can also be provided.

All parameters aside from \code{object} and \code{dir_path} are only used if \code{object}
is not a \code{familiarCollection} object, or a path to one.

Both single and ensemble predictions are exported.
